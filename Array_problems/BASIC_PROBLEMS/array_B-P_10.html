            for (let char of myArray);

        </h5>

        <p class="hightlight">INSIGHT:</p>
        <p>What's happening here is , we are defining value every index as "char" of myArray. The 'FOR' then will try to iterate all the char. and console.log it one by one.</p>


        <script>
            

            let myArray2 = ["N","A","M","E"];
            for(let char of myArray2){
              console.log(char);
            }
        </script>
