    <h1>Acessing The Last Element Of myArray.</h1>

    <p>
      For accessing the last element of myArray, we we don't know the exact
      lenght of array.
    </p>
    <p>We can achieve that by doing this.</p>

    <h5>
        <BR>let myArray = ["", "s","o","m","e","t","h","i","n","g"];</BR>
      console.log(myArray[myArray.length - 1]);
    </h5>
    <p>
      "myArray.lenght": gives the total lenght of the array. So,to get the last
      one we need to subtract 1 from the total lenght . Counting starts from
      index 0 and goes to 'n' so the length will be "n+1".{counting =>> 0 = 1 ;
      1-n = n => total counting = n+1}
    </p>

    <script>

      let myArray = ["", "s","o","m","e","t","h","i","n","g"];
      console.log(myArray[myArray.length - 1]);
    </script>
  </body>
