If you are a beginner then it's a really very great set of practice for you to master one of most used and imporatnt part of WEB-DEV, that is <ARRAY>.

<ARRAY's> are everywhere in WEB-DEV, and one of the powerful tool to store data's . So, to master the web-DEV you would reqiure to under and conqure the concepts of it's working and how you can manage , create and manupulate the <ARRAY's>.

> I'm pretty confident that after solving all the questions there won't be anything about ARRAY that will make you think even for a second while working over big projects. 

These problems are best suited for <couragous BEGINNERs> who are gioing to dive in the vast world of WEB-DEV . And who does'nt want to start with a strong foundations . These are the foundational that will really help you understand the arrays better non the less mastering it , if you solves all the problems. 

Coming to the problems , so basically i divided these sets of problem into 3 Levels .
